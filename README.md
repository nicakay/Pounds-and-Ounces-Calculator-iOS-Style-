# Pounds and Ounces Calculator (iOS Style)
Calculator that perform calculations with Pounds and Ounces in iOS-like layout.
If is my first project made in Java Script.

The Pounds & Ounces Calculator does the following:
* **Adds** _Pounds & Ounces_ to _Pounds & Ounces_
* **Substract** _Pounds & Ounces_ from _Pounds & Ounces_
* **Multiplies** _Pounds & Ounces_ by _Integers_
* **Divides** _Pounds & Ounces_ by _Integers_

## How to use the Calculator
The Pounds & Ounces Calculator does not currently support keyboards, so in order to put values into the input field you will need to use a mouse (or a touch if you're on mobile).

The calculator operates in the avoirdupois system, where there are **16 ounces in 1 pound**. Therefore a **dot can only be followed by a value that is lower than 16**.

You can use the following buttons of the main panel:
* 0-9 - to input digits
* . - dot to separate pounds from ounces
* +-x√∑ - to use math symbols
* Del - to delete the last entered character
* AC - to clear the input, output and memory
